<p>My name is Ethan McCoy, and I'm a first year student at <strong>NC State University</strong> hoping to get a major in Aerospace engineering.
The most impactful factor as too my fascination and interest in aerospace engineering has to be growing up with my dad. 
Throughout my early childhood up until <ins>8th grade</ins>, I would always have fond memories of working on cars with my dad in the garage. 
Whether it was changing the oil, brakes, headlights, or even installing a radio once. In addition, I would always watch space exploration and astronomy documentaries with him. 
In the end that hands-on experience and time spent with my dad instilled a deep interest in working with mechanics as well as understanding the vast expanse of our solar system.
</p>
<br />
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #FF0000; text-align: left;">Following my intended major and completing college goals that I have in mind the dream job I would want to have is working
with a tech company or any aerospace/aeronautical engineering companies. In addiiton, I hope that throughout my experience at
NC State that I will get the experience needed to secure these jobs and work proficient in them.
